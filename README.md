# Crowdfunding ETL Project
This project is all about flexing our ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) muscles using Python, Pandas, and either the Python dictionary methods or regular expressions. By the end, we'll have a structured database filled with crowdfunding data, ready for analysis!

## Project Overview
For this one-week mini project, we're teaming up to:
- Extract and clean data from Excel files (crowdfunding.xlsx & contacts.xlsx)
- Transform the data into four structured CSV files
- Design an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and define our table schema
- Load the cleaned data into a Postgres database
